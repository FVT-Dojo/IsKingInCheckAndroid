Pomodoro 1:
✅ Create code that displays a chessboard after the button has been clicked.
    ✅Refactor: chessboard to its own file
    ✅Refactor: test chessboard composable

Pomodoro iDunno:
    - ✅ Create snapshot test with paparazzi
    - ✅ Add first API call

TODO:
    - Update E2E test to include a mock of the API, such that the chessboard shows the pieces
    - After this works, extract ugly logic from the screen to more adhere to MVVM / MVC / whatever
        and to be able to unit test the pieces.
